# sign-in-with-apple

This function:

1. Exchanges an authorization code with Apple to obtain the user's id token.
1. If a user with matching id or email doesn't exist, a new user will be created.
1. The user's email will be verified if is hasn't been already.
1. A token will be returned allowing the user to exchange the token for a session via `account.createSession()`.

> Note: this function uses an md5 hash of the `sub` as the user's id since the value from Apple is too long and has unsupported characters.
